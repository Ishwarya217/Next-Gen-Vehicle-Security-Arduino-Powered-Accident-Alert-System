**Next-Gen Vehicle Security: Arduino-Powered Accident Alert System**

## Project Overview
This project aims to improve vehicle safety by detecting accidents and sending instant alerts to emergency contacts. The system utilizes an Arduino along with various sensors and modules, such as GPS, GSM, LCD, switches, and an accelerometer, to detect accidents promptly and notify emergency personnel, reducing response time and potentially saving lives.

## Key Features
1. Accident Detection: Detects accidents using an accelerometer to sense sudden changes in motion.
2. Real-Time Location Tracking: The GPS module provides the vehicle's location in real time.
3. Emergency Alerts: Sends an SMS alert with location information to emergency contacts via the GSM module.
4. Onboard Display: Displays system status and alert information on an LCD.
5. Cost-Effective and Reliable: Designed to be affordable and reliable, allowing for widespread application across various vehicle types.
